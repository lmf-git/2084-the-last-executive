## Uninhabitable Zones

### The Flooded Zones
Rising sea levels and dam failures created vast coastal flooding:

- **Current Status:** Inland seas with scattered island communities
- **Population:** ~200,000 (maritime culture)
- **Resources:** Offshore drilling platforms, fishing grounds

### The Ash Lands
Nuclear incidents and industrial fires created uninhabitable zones:

#### Midwest Crater Fields
- **Former Area:** Industrial centers around Chicago, Detroit
- **Current Status:** Radioactive wastelands with automated facilities
- **Population:** 0 (uninhabitable)
- **Challenges:** Radiation, toxic soil, automated defenses

#### California Burn Zone
- **Former Area:** Central Valley and Southern California
- **Current Status:** Permanent fire storms from climate change
- **Population:** 0 (uninhabitable)
- **Environmental:** Perpetual wildfires, toxic air

#### Texas Dust Bowl
- **Former Area:** Eastern Texas plains
- **Current Status:** Extreme desertification from warfare
- **Population:** ~50,000 (nomadic communities)
- **Challenges:** Water scarcity, dust storms, extreme heat

## Contested Territories

### No Man's Land
- **Location:** Central border zone between FAS and RNC
- **Width:** Approximately 50-100 km buffer zone
- **Status:** Constant low-level warfare, shifting control
- **Population:** Minimal (refugees, scavengers, deserters)
- **Hazards:** Unexploded ordnance, patrol conflicts

### Resource Zones
- **Type:** Areas with critical resources claimed by both factions
- **Examples:** Water sources, mineral deposits, fuel refineries
- **Status:** Frequent raids and counter-raids
- **Civilian Impact:** Local populations caught between factions

### Transport Corridors
- **Function:** Critical supply routes between territories
- **Security:** Heavily patrolled, frequently attacked
- **Strategic Value:** Control determines faction logistics capability
- **Examples:** Interstate highways, rail lines, shipping channels

## Neutral Zones

### Maritime Communities
- **Location:** Great Lakes and coastal waters
- **Population:** ~2 million
- **Status:** Neutral traders serving both factions
- **Governance:** Informal councils, maritime law
- **Economy:** Trade, fishing, smuggling

### Mountain Enclaves
- **Location:** High-altitude settlements in Rocky Mountains
- **Population:** ~500,000
- **Status:** Isolated communities avoiding faction conflict
- **Characteristics:** Self-sufficient, defensive, traditional values
- **Challenges:** Harsh climate, limited resources

### Underground Networks
- **Location:** Subway systems, tunnel networks, basements
- **Population:** ~1 million
- **Status:** Hidden communities avoiding surface conflict
- **Examples:** NYC subway dwellers, Chicago tunnel systems
- **Survival:** Scavenging, underground agriculture, recycling

## Strategic Resources

### Water Sources
- **Great Lakes:** Shared resource creating tension
- **River Systems:** Control points for transportation and irrigation
- **Aquifers:** Underground water increasingly critical
- **Desalination:** Coastal facilities for clean water production

### Energy Production
- **Nuclear Plants:** Few remaining facilities heavily guarded
- **Renewable Energy:** Wind and solar farms in RNC territory
- **Fossil Fuels:** Coal mines and oil refineries in FAS control
- **Hydroelectric:** Dam systems provide power and flood control

### Agricultural Zones
- **Prairie Farmland:** Limited arable land in RNC territory
- **Greenhouse Complexes:** Indoor agriculture in urban areas
- **Livestock Operations:** Protein production in secure facilities
- **Fishing Grounds:** Marine resources in coastal and lake areas

## Transportation Networks

### Functional Routes
- **Interstate Highways:** Limited sections still operational
- **Rail Systems:** Freight lines maintained for strategic resources
- **Waterways:** Ships and boats for bulk cargo transport
- **Air Travel:** Military and emergency flights only

### Communication Systems
- **Internet Infrastructure:** Partially functional, heavily monitored
- **Radio Networks:** Primary communication for both factions
