# World Lore: 2084: The Last Executive

## The Decimation (2081-2084)

### The Collapse
The global conflict known as "The Decimation" began in 2081 when cascading climate disasters coincided with resource wars and technological warfare. Unlike previous world wars, the Decimation was characterized by:

- **Infrastructure Targeting:** Deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure
- **Information Warfare:** Mass manipulation of populations through AI-generated propaganda
- **Resource Monopolization:** Control of water, food, and energy sources as weapons
- **Technological Disruption:** EMP attacks and cyber warfare crippled global communications

### The Great Manipulation
What appeared to be spontaneous conflicts were actually orchestrated by a shadow network led by The Executive. Using his knowledge of government systems and international relations, he:

- Triggered initial resource conflicts through market manipulation
- Coordinated cyber attacks to destabilize governments
- Positioned himself as a "stabilizing force" while secretly fueling chaos
- Established the proxy war between FAS and RNC to maintain control
