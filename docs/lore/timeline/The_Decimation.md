# The Decimation Timeline (2081-2084)

## Overview
The global conflict known as "The Decimation" began in 2081 when cascading climate disasters coincided with resource wars and technological warfare. Unlike previous world wars, the Decimation was characterized by deliberate infrastructure targeting, mass information manipulation, and resource weaponization.

- **Potential Peace:** Opportunity for genuine conflict resolution

## Key Turning Points

### Climate Catalyst
- **Trigger Event:** Hurricane Manhattan devastates Eastern Seaboard

- **Government Paralysis:** Federal response proves inadequate
- **Local Solutions:** Regional authorities take independent action

### Faction Crystallization
- **Geographic Division:** Natural boundaries between FAS and RNC territory
- **Ideological Split:** Authoritarian vs. democratic approaches to crisis
- **Resource Control:** Competition over remaining functional infrastructure
- **Military Organization:** Former military units choose faction allegiance

### Shadow Manipulation
- **Executive's Network:** Pre-positioned assets in both factions
- **Technology Control:** Advanced weapons development under shadow control
- **Information Warfare:** Propaganda campaigns fueling mutual hatred
- **Proxy Conflict:** Deliberate perpetuation of war for population control

## Technological Timeline

### 2081: Foundation
- **Gravity Research:** Initial experiments in government facilities
- **AI Propaganda:** First deployment of synthetic media generation
- **Infrastructure Warfare:** Cyber attacks on civilian systems
- **Surveillance State:** Mass monitoring systems activated

### 2082: Development
- **Weapons Integration:** Gravity technology adapted for military use
- **Communication Control:** Information networks centralized
- **Transportation Systems:** Control of remaining logistics networks
- **Medical Technology:** Life support systems for aging Executive

### 2083: Deployment
- **Field Testing:** Gravity weapons tested in conflict zones
- **Mass Production:** Limited manufacturing of advanced systems
- **Intelligence Networks:** Comprehensive spy systems in both factions
- **Facility Construction:** Executive's bunker complex completed

### 2084: Revelation
- **Technology Exposed:** RNC discovers gravity research facility
- **System Integration:** Executive's final suit combining all technologies
- **Network Breakdown:** Discovery exposes shadow communication systems
- **Final Confrontation:** All advanced systems deployed in bunker defense

## Casualties and Impact

### Human Cost
- **Direct Military:** Estimated 2.3 million combatant casualties
- **Civilian Deaths:** Approximately 8.7 million non-combatant losses
- **Displacement:** 45 million internal refugees across North America
- **Missing Persons:** 1.2 million unaccounted for individuals

### Infrastructure Destruction
- **Urban Centers:** 12 major cities significantly damaged or abandoned
- **Transportation:** 40% of highway and rail networks non-functional
- **Power Grid:** 60% of electrical infrastructure destroyed or damaged
- **Communication:** 30% of internet and telephone systems disrupted

### Environmental Damage
- **Industrial Pollution:** Chemical releases from damaged facilities
- **Nuclear Incidents:** Three reactor meltdowns due to infrastructure failure
- **Agricultural Collapse:** 70% reduction in food production capacity
- **Water Contamination:** Multiple aquifer systems compromised

## Aftermath Possibilities

### Peaceful Resolution
