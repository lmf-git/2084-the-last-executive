## Complete Script: Level 01 - "The Sinking Penitent"

### Opening Cinematic

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. COASTAL ESTUARY - DAWN**

*The camera slowly pans across a desolate, flooded landscape. The skeletal remains of a once-imposing prison complex jut from the murky water like the ribs of some massive beast.*

**INT. PRISON CELL - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS**

*Dark, murky water. Bubbles rise toward the surface. A hand, weathered and scarred, pushes against a rusted grate. The camera pulls back to reveal KAELEN VEX, 32, struggling to free himself from a submerged cell.*

**VEX (V.O.)**
*(Internal monologue)*
They told me the war was over. That my country had surrendered. A lie. They just wanted me to rot.

*Vex shoves the grate aside with a grunt of effort, creating a cloud of rust and debris. He swims out into a flooded corridor, his breath becoming short.*

**SOUND:** Faint gunfire echoes from somewhere above.

**RADIO STATIC (O.S., DISTORTED)**
...Breach! Breach! Upper tier! All units respond!

*Vex surfaces in an air pocket, gasping desperately. Water drips from his face as he looks around the partially flooded corridor. Emergency lighting flickers, casting eerie shadows.*

**VEX**
*(To himself, catching breath)*
Not today. Not ever.

*He spots a floating supply crate, breaks it open, and retrieves a waterlogged pistol and a single magazine. Vex checks the weapon's action - it's functional but unreliable.*

### Gameplay Section 1: Underwater Navigation

**OBJECTIVE DISPLAY:** "Escape the flooded cell block"

*Player gains control. Swimming mechanics tutorial through environmental storytelling. Vex must navigate underwater corridors, avoiding debris and finding air pockets.*

**SOUND DESIGN:**
- Muffled underwater acoustics
- Distant structural groaning
- Player's heartbeat increasing as breath meter depletes

**ENVIRONMENTAL DETAILS:**
- Prison cells with personal belongings floating inside
- Skeletal remains in some cells
- Emergency lighting creating dramatic underwater caustics

### First Combat Encounter

**INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - PARTIALLY FLOODED**

*Vex climbs onto a walkway. Two RNC GUARDS patrol ahead, unaware of his presence.*

**RNC GUARD 1**
*(Into radio)*
Section C is clear. Still no sign of the FAS prisoners.

**RNC GUARD 2**
Good. Command wants them found before the structure fails completely.

*Player choice: Stealth takedown or direct confrontation. Combat tutorials integrated into encounter.*

**VEX**
*(After engagement, to himself)*
Sorry, boys. Wrong place, wrong time.

### Structural Collapse Sequence

**SOUND:** Deep rumbling, followed by a massive CRACK.

**RADIO STATIC (O.S.)**
Sector 4 is compromised! The foundation's failing!

*Water rushes in from multiple directions. The corridor Vex just traversed collapses behind him. He's forced to move forward quickly.*

**VEX**
*(Urgent)*
Shit! This whole place is coming down!

*Player must navigate collapsing environment while water levels rise. Tutorial for destructible environment mechanics.*

### Boat Discovery

**INT. PRISON BOAT STORAGE - FLOODED**

*Vex enters a large chamber where prison transport boats were stored. Most are damaged, but one small patrol craft appears functional.*

**VEX**
*(Approaching the boat)*
You're a lifesaver.

*He examines the engine, checking fuel and ignition systems.*

**VEX (CONT'D)**
*(Starting engine)*
Come on... come on...

*The engine sputters to life. Relief crosses Vex's face.*

### Chase Sequence

**EXT. COASTAL ESTUARY - DAWN**

*Vex pilots the boat through the flooded prison complex. Behind him, RNC patrol boats emerge from hidden positions.*

**RNC RADIO (O.S.)**
Unknown vessel, cut your engine and prepare to be boarded!

**VEX**
*(Gunning the engine)*
Not happening!

*High-speed chase through flooded ruins. Player learns boat physics and evasive maneuvering.*

**GAMEPLAY MECHANICS:**
- Steering while avoiding debris
- Using environmental destruction to block pursuers
- Managing fuel and engine damage

**SOUND DESIGN:**
- Engine roar and water spray
- Gunfire from pursuing boats
- Metal grinding as boat scrapes obstacles

### Bridge Jump Sequence

**EXT. COLLAPSED HIGHWAY BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS**

*Ahead, a partially collapsed bridge creates a narrow gap. The pursuing boats are gaining.*

**VEX**
*(Gritting teeth)*
This is gonna hurt.

*Player must time the jump perfectly. Vex's boat launches over the gap as RNC boats either crash or turn back.*

**CINEMATIC MOMENT:**
- Slow-motion jump sequence
- Camera follows boat through the air
- Splash-down in relative safety beyond

### Extraction Point

**EXT. FAS CONTROLLED SHORELINE - MORNING**

*Vex's boat approaches a makeshift dock where FAS soldiers wait. He's finally reached friendly territory.*

**FAS SOLDIER**
*(Helping Vex dock)*
Corporal Vex? We thought you were dead.

**VEX**
*(Climbing out, exhausted)*
So did I. Brief me - what's the situation?

**FAS SOLDIER**
Command wants to see you immediately. There's... work to be done.

*Vex looks back at the prison complex, now mostly submerged. Smoke rises from several points.*

**VEX (V.O.)**
*(Internal monologue)*
I thought escape was the hard part. I was wrong.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
