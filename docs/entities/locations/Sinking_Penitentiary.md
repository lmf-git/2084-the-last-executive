- **Status:** Partially submerged, structurally compromised
- **Current Use:** Emergency prisoner detention (Level 1 setting)

## Physical Description

### Original Structure
- **Construction:** 1970s brutalist concrete and steel prison complex
- **Capacity:** 2,400 inmates across 8 cellblocks
- **Architecture:** Rectangular cell blocks connected by central corridor spine
- **Fortification:** High walls, guard towers, administrative complex

### Current Condition (2084)
- **Flood Damage:** Lower three levels completely submerged
- **Structural Integrity:** 40% compromised, ongoing collapse
- **Water Level:** Varies with tide, typically 4-6 meters in main corridors
- **Accessibility:** Only upper levels and emergency exits remain functional

## Environmental Characteristics

### Flooding Patterns
- **Tidal Influence:** Water levels fluctuate with ocean tides
- **Storm Surge:** Severe weather can flood additional levels
- **Fresh Water Mix:** River confluence creates brackish conditions
- **Ice Conditions:** Winter freezing affects water access and structure

### Atmospheric Conditions
- **Humidity:** Extremely high, constant condensation
- **Air Quality:** Mold, rust, and chemical contamination
- **Lighting:** Emergency power only, frequent outages
- **Temperature:** Cold, damp, poor insulation

### Wildlife and Hazards
- **Marine Life:** Fish, crabs, algae in flooded sections
- **Structural Hazards:** Unstable floors, exposed electrical systems
- **Chemical Contamination:** Industrial runoff, sewage backup
- **Air Pockets:** Unpredictable breathing spaces in submerged areas

## Historical Context

### Pre-War Function
- **Civilian Prison:** Standard correctional facility for regional offenders
- **Capacity Issues:** Overcrowded due to climate refugee influx
- **Infrastructure Problems:** Aging systems inadequate for population
- **Location Vulnerability:** Built before sea level rise projections

### War Conversion
- **Military Use:** RNC converted to POW detention facility
- **Prisoner Population:** FAS soldiers, suspected collaborators, political dissidents
- **Security Modifications:** Additional barriers, restricted access
- **Resource Limitations:** Minimal maintenance due to war priorities

### The Flooding
- **Dam Failure:** Upstream infrastructure collapse during 2083 conflict
- **Storm Surge:** Hurricane-force weather accelerated flooding
- **Evacuation Failure:** Prisoner transfer incomplete when flooding began
- **Current Status:** Partial abandonment, emergency use only

## Strategic Significance

### Military Value
- **Prisoner Detention:** Holding FAS personnel for interrogation
- **Intelligence Gathering:** Information extraction from captured soldiers
- **Psychological Warfare:** Demonstration of RNC control over FAS personnel
- **Resource Drain:** Maintenance costs versus strategic benefit

### Geographic Importance
- **Coastal Control:** Position controls access to inland waterways
- **Supply Route:** Located on pre-war shipping channel
- **Defensive Position:** Natural barriers limit approach routes
- **Symbolic Value:** Former civilian facility now military installation

## Security Systems

### Perimeter Defense
- **Water Barriers:** Flooding creates natural moat around facility
- **Guard Boats:** Patrol craft monitor approaches
- **Sensor Network:** Motion detectors on accessible routes
- **Communication:** Radio links to RNC coastal command

### Internal Security
- **Restricted Access:** Upper levels only, many areas sealed
- **Emergency Lighting:** Battery-powered systems in critical areas
- **Manual Locks:** Electronic systems disabled due to water damage
- **Guard Presence:** Minimal staffing due to harsh conditions

### Structural Weaknesses
- **Foundation Damage:** Concrete deterioration from water exposure
- **Electrical Failure:** Most systems non-functional due to flooding
- **Access Routes:** Limited evacuation options in emergency
- **Communication Dead Zones:** Signal interference from metal structure

## Gameplay Implications

### Level Design Opportunities
- **Vertical Navigation:** Multi-level structure with water transitions
- **Environmental Storytelling:** Personal belongings in abandoned cells
- **Atmospheric Horror:** Dark, claustrophobic underwater sections
- **Dynamic Environment:** Changing water levels affect routes

### Technical Challenges
- **Water Physics:** Realistic swimming and buoyancy mechanics
- **Lighting Design:** Emergency lighting creates dramatic shadows
- **Audio Environment:** Underwater acoustics and dripping ambience
- **Destruction Sequences:** Structural collapse triggered by damage

### Narrative Elements
- **Desperation Setting:** Harsh conditions reflect war's brutality
- **Symbolic Resonance:** Prison represents larger themes of imprisonment and freedom
- **Character Introduction:** Vex's resourcefulness demonstrated through survival
- **Moral Ambiguity:** Both sides use harsh detention methods

## Environmental Storytelling

### Personal Effects
- **Cell Contents:** Prisoner belongings reveal individual stories
- **Guard Stations:** Abandoned posts show hasty evacuation
- **Administrative Records:** Paperwork reveals facility operations
- **Maintenance Logs:** Evidence of declining conditions

### Institutional Decay
- **Propaganda Posters:** RNC messaging about prisoner treatment
- **Medical Facilities:** Inadequate healthcare for harsh conditions
- **Food Storage:** Empty supply areas show resource scarcity
- **Communication Equipment:** Failed attempts to maintain operations

### Human Impact
- **Graffiti and Messages:** Prisoner communication attempts
- **Escape Attempts:** Evidence of previous breakout efforts
- **Guard Quarters:** Personal items of facility staff
- **Visitor Areas:** Abandoned spaces for family contact

## Cultural and Thematic Significance

### Prison Industrial Complex
- **Civilian to Military:** Conversion represents war's expansion into civilian infrastructure
- **Dehumanization:** Harsh conditions show war's effect on moral standards
- **Resource Allocation:** Military priorities over humanitarian concerns
- **Institutional Failure:** System breakdown under pressure

### Environmental Catastrophe
- **Climate Change:** Rising waters represent larger environmental challenges
- **Infrastructure Collapse:** Aging systems failing under stress
- **Adaptation Challenges:** Difficulty maintaining civilization under pressure
- **Natural vs. Human:** Environmental forces overwhelming human institutions

### Resistance and Survival
- **Individual Agency:** Vex's escape represents personal resistance
- **Institutional vs. Personal:** Individual morality versus system demands
- **Survival Skills:** Resourcefulness in hostile environment
- **Hope vs. Despair:** Finding strength in desperate circumstances

## Technical Specifications
